# Lab-1 Git Repository Seed

# Author: Wisdom Tochi Kalu

This file is the template for the first lab in Ashesi Web Development 2020.
the link to my website is:
https://wisdomfromabove.github.io/simple_portfolio/

## Contents

This repository contains five HTML files, one CSS file and a script for gathering the basic configuration of the user from bash.
This will be used as my portfolio site in the interim.
The website is in no way efficient as I built it with stateless html


## Using the file

I referred to the lab instructions and cloned this repository to a new repository in my user space.
